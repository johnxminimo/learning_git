        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        
        <p>Links are created with the anchor tag, <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/links-and-images">"a"</a> + a hyperlink reference in the opening ta. <p>
        
        <p>There are two kinds of links, relative links and absolute links. Relative links link to pages within the same site/domain, whereas asbolute links
        link to a page located on a different domain, and includes protocol://domain. An example of an absolute link would be https://www.youtube.com/</p>
        
        <p>Relative links do not contain the domain/protocol since they are located in the same directory, and only require the foldername it is located in 
        or its name if located in the same folder. <a href="../html-boilerplate/index.html">Relative link to first html page.</a></p>
        
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>In order to add images, the tag img is used, followed by the source of the image in the opening tag, img src=./images/linktoimage would be the
        proper way of doing so. Alt text should also be used, in the case that an image is unable to be loaded. Alt text should be a description of the image 
        as it can also be used by screen readers/accessibility. For example, alt text for a golden retriever dog would be "A golden retriever". </p>
        <img src="./images/dog.jpeg" alt="This is an image of a golden retriever">
