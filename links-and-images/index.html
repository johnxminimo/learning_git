        <p>Links are created with the anchor tag, <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/links-and-images">"a"</a> + a hyperlink reference in the opening ta. <p>
        <p>There are two kinds of links, relative links and absolute links. Relative links link to pages within the same site/domain, whereas asbolute links
        link to a page located on a different domain, and includes protocol://domain. An example of an absolute link would be https://www.youtube.com/</p>
        <h3>Relative links do not contain the domain/protocol since they are located in the same directory, and only require the foldername it is located in 
        or its name if located in the same folder. <a href="../html-boilerplate/index.html">Relative link to first html page.</a></h3>
